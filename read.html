<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.</p>
<hr>
<p>
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing)
is the tweet archive of Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates">@dog_rates</a>,
 also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs">WeRateDogs</a>.
 WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous
  comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
